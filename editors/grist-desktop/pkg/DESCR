Grist Desktop is an Electron build of Grist. Use it to easily open
and edit Grist spreadsheets on your computer. It does not need the
internet, and will work fine on a desert island (assuming you can
find a power outlet). It is not tied to any online account or
service.

This build is handy for all sorts of things, like editing splits
for ML training runs, analyzing some CSV or JSON data, or preparing
some structured lists for a batch job.

It is also the quickest way to demonstrate to the skeptical that a
Grist spreadsheet on a hosted service really is fully self-contained,
and that you could download it and work with it on your own hardware
if you needed to.

For hosting Grist spreadsheets on a server for use by a team, better
options are grist-core and grist-omnibus.
