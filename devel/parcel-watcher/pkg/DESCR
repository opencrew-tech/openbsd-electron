A native C++ Node module for querying and subscribing to filesystem
events. Used by Parcel 2.

Watch - subscribe to realtime recursive directory change notifications
when files or directories are created, updated, or deleted.

Query - performantly query for historical change events in a
directory, even when your program is not running.

Native - implemented in C++ for performance and low-level integration
with the operating system.

Cross platform - includes backends for macOS, Linux, Windows,
FreeBSD, and Watchman.

Performant - events are throttled in C++ so the JavaScript thread
is not overwhelmed during large filesystem changes (e.g. git checkout
or npm install).

Scalable - tens of thousands of files can be watched or queried at
once with good performance.
